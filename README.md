# beginners-js
A very basic repo where JS beginners (and others!) can add functionality to an HTML page using JavaScript. The intention of this project is to allow less-experienced programmers to practice all parts of front-end, as well as making pull requests and contributing to GitHub projects. Want to become a contributor? Just send me an email with your username at rebecka.nylander at hotmail.com!

HTML:

While making edits to index.html, please do not delete or change the order, ids, types or other attributes to already existing elements, as this may break others' code. If you feel insecure about whether your changes to index.html will violate this principle, please push your own copy by a different name instead. Remember not to push any script tags containing JS file references to index.html, but only changes in the HTML itself. If, however, you are uploading your own .html file, please add all the references you need in that file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript:

Apart from the code itself, to be accepted and merged every JS file should include a minimum of:

1. A comment naming any frameworks used in your code (e.g. // "Uses JQuery")
2. A comment containing a brief explanation of what functionality your code adds to the document

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional comments:

Free free to also add in any additional comments you feel are necessary or useful to understand your code.

While it's good to try your best to make sure that your code runs properly before making a pull request or push to this repo, do not be afraid of "breaking" the original code/markup - we'll work any issues out without angry comments, I promise :)

(If you want to be extra sure you won't break anything, please create a new folder by the name of your GitHub username and add all the HTML, CSS and JS files needed for your version to that before pushing/making a pull request.)
